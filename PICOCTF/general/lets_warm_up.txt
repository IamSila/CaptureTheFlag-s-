This challenge is about converting a hexadecimal value to a ascii character
I went ahead and wrote a bash script to perform this task


hexadecimal =  $(echo '0x70')
for value in $hexadecimal; do
    echo $value | xxd -r #reverses the string
done


the command xxd is used to convert data to hex dumps.Passing the flag -r simply reverses this hex dump value {0x70} back to binary data
{p}.To solve the flag, use the format picoCTF{p} and submit.

Yaay challenge solved.
