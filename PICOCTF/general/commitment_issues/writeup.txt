This challenge is testing information disclosure under github
download the challenge zip, unzip using the command below
	unzip [filename]
observe it is a git folder
cat message.txt and I observe it has nothing
After visiting all the other repositories and finding no flag, I download "git-cola" a gui based
utility for dealing with github commits push and alot more.
I undo a commit and boom the flag lies there
